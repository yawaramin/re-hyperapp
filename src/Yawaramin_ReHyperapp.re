  /** Type of a custom component (i.e. a capitalized JSX element). This
      module type makes it possible to create higher-order components
      using OCaml functors, by declaring the functors to accept and
      return this type as input and output. Using this module type also
      enables the compiler to infer better types for state and actions,
      and avoids type errors caused by the value restriction on object
      types. I strongly recommend enforcing this module type as it will
      guide you through the steps of creating the module--i.e. adding the
      required types and values. See also [StaticComponent] for an easy
      way to create stateless (and actionaless) components.

      Strictly speaking, this exact type is not needed to support custom
      elements in JSX; at a minimum, the JSX transform just needs the
      last parameter ([children]), but usually you'll want to pass in
      state and actions objects, because the first two parameters are how
      Hyperapp threads state and actions through custom components.

      Note that you'll need to define the [state] and [actions] {i types}
      as OCaml object types, but instantiate the [state] and [actions]
      {i values} as BuckleScript objects. See
      [Yawaramin_ReHyperapp_Demo_Component_Main.re] for more details.

      See also [ReasonReact] for more details on capitalized components,
      and [Yawaramin_ReHyperapp_Demo_Component_Main.rei] for an example
      of how to enforce this module type on a file component. */

        It's important that the functions are explicitly curried, all
        take a payload (or more) as the first parameter, possibly take
        the current state as the second curried parameter, and return a
        JavaScript object type that is some subset of the state type.
